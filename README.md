Microflix

For our Data Science first project, we are going to work on a movie proposal for Microsoft. We called it: Microflix.

Microsoft sees that it's leaving money on the table for not creating original video content like other big companies. They want to follow the trend and disrupt the market. Their main issue: they don't have any intelligence in this area.

Our goal is to help them understand the movie/television industry, analyze some data, talk to them about the industry and make some recommandations. We will used our web scraping, api, sql and python skills to answer a couple of questions that would help Microsoft CEO getting enough insights to launch Microflix.

Our focus is to generate buzz and engagment, with the understanding that the company's first foray into the Original Content generation space will be a potential sunk cost.  There will be no revenue to generate from the film, as its purpose is to increase subscriber count.  

The Data Science Students in charge: Fabrice - Hamilton - Xristos

Our codes and presentation are saved in the folder and should help any third party to replicate our works.
