Project Presentation:

For our Data Science first project, we are going to work on a movie proposal for Microsoft. We called it: Microflix.

Microsoft sees that it's leaving money on the table for not creating original video content like other big companies. They want to follow the trend and disrupt the market. Their main issue: they don't have any intelligence in this area.

Our goal is to help them understand the movie/television industry, analyze some data, talk to them about the industry and make some recommendations. We will used our web scraping, api, sql and python skills to answer a couple of questions that would help Microsoft CEO getting enough insights to launch Microflix.

Questions to be answered:
- What should be our targeted market?
- What genre should we propose?
- What should be the actor profile to cast?

Focus:
Our focus is to generate buzz and engagement, with the understanding that the company's first foray into the Original Content generation space will be a potential sunk cost.  There will be no revenue to generate from the film, as its purpose is to increase subscriber count.  

Methodology:
- Webscraping - Collection of genre data over 20 years in the film industry. http://www.the_numbers.com
- API - Collection of individualized film data including genre, box office revenue, major actors.  Additionally pulled API  to determine the popularity of actors for further refinement of strategy.

- Python for data anlaysis and SQL for database management

Findings:
Action market share is peakingâ€¨- Adventure market share is rising



Most popular actors under action and adventure as well:


Good producers needed:

Recommendations:
Adventure film would possess broad appeal
Recruit a small stable of popular adventure genre stars
For directors, we have a bit more flexibility, one from the popularity list would advance our goal in creating additional buzz
